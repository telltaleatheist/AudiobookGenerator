  list-edge-tts-voices - List Edge TTS voices based on provided filters
  run-pipeline - Convert text to speech using a cascaded pipeline combining Edge TTS and RVC. The text is first converted to speech using Edge TTS, and then that speech is converted to a different voice using RVC

Voice Conversion Command
urvc generate convert-voice [voice_track] [directory] [model_name]

Required Arguments:
  voice_track (FILE) - The path to the voice track to convert
  directory (DIRECTORY) - The path to the directory where the converted voice track will be saved
  model_name (TEXT) - The name of the model to use for voice conversion

Main Options:
  --n-octaves (INTEGER) - The number of octaves to pitch-shift the converted voice by. Use 1 for male-to-female and -1 for vice-versa (default: 0)
  --n-semitones (INTEGER) - The number of semi-tones to pitch-shift the converted voice by. Altering this slightly reduces sound quality (default: 0)

Voice Synthesis Options:
  --f0-method [rmvpe|crepe|crepe-tiny|fcpe] - The method to use for pitch extraction. Can be provided multiple times to use multiple methods in combination. Defaults to rmvpe method (recommended)
  --index-rate (0-1) - The rate of influence of the index file. Increase to bias conversion towards the accent of the voice model. Decrease to potentially reduce artifacts (default: 0.3)
  --rms-mix-rate (0-1) - Blending rate for the volume envelope. Controls how much to mimic the loudness of the input voice (0) or a fixed loudness (1) (default: 1.0)
  --protect-rate (0-0.5) - Controls the extent to which consonants and breathing sounds are protected from artifacts. Higher value offers more protection but may worsen the indexing effect (default: 0.33)
  --hop-length (1-512) - Controls how often the CREPE-based pitch extraction method checks for pitch changes in milliseconds. Lower values lead to longer conversion times and higher risk of voice cracks, but better pitch accuracy (default: 128)

Voice Enrichment Options:
  --split-voice / --no-split-voice - Whether to split the voice track into smaller segments before converting. Can improve output quality for longer tracks (default: no-split-voice)
  --autotune-voice / --no-autotune-voice - Whether to apply autotune to the converted voice (default: no-autotune-voice)
  --autotune-strength (0-1) - The intensity of the autotune effect. Higher values result in stronger snapping to the chromatic grid (default: 1.0)
  --clean-voice / --no-clean-voice - Whether to clean the converted voice using noise reduction algorithms (default: no-clean-voice)
  --clean-strength (0-1) - The intensity of the cleaning to apply. Higher values result in stronger cleaning, but may lead to a more compressed sound (default: 0.7)

Speaker Embeddings Options:
  --embedder-model [contentvec|chinese-hubert-base|japanese-hubert-base|korean-hubert-base|custom] - The model to use for generating speaker embeddings (default: contentvec)
  --custom-embedder-model (TEXT) - The name of a custom embedder model to use. Only applicable if embedder-model is set to custom
  --sid (INTEGER) - The id of the speaker to use for multi-speaker RVC models (default: 0)

urvc generate speech run-edge-tts [source]

Required Arguments:
  source (TEXT) - A string or path to a file containing the text to be converted

Options:
  --voice (TEXT) - The short name of the Edge TTS voice which should speak the provided text. Use list-edge-voices command to get available voices (default: en-US-ChristopherNeural)
  --pitch-shift (INTEGER) - The number of hertz to shift the pitch of the Edge TTS voice (default: 0)
  --speed-change (INTEGER) - The percentual change to the speed of the Edge TTS voice (default: 0)
  --volume-change (INTEGER) - The percentual change to the volume of the Edge TTS voice (default: 0)

Edge TTS + RVC Pipeline Command
urvc generate speech run-pipeline [source] [model_name]

Required Arguments:
  source (TEXT) - A string or path to a file containing the text to be converted
  model_name (TEXT) - The name of the RVC model to use for speech conversion
